# challenge-06-weather-dashboard

## Description

This is a project for UW bootcamp in which we were asked to create a weather dashboard that will display the current weather and five day forecast for a selected city.

## Installation

## Usage

On searching for a city, that city's current weather and five day forecast will be displayed on the page. The searched city will be added to the search bar as a button and saved in local storage. Any city can be clicked on once it is added to the search bar and its weather data will be displayed.
